## Converter Interface
Converter Interface is an application that creates two implementations of a converter interface. One implementation being the use of "if"/"else if"/"else" statements called ```ConverterIf```. The second being, the use of switch statements in a class called ```ConverterSwitch```. Tests are included with this project.

## Calculate Object
Calculate Object is an application that includes methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for two integers parameters and another for two double parameters. Located in the main you can find examples of the methods in use, each printing out the calculation being performed and the result. Tests are included with this project.

## Ice Cream Design
Ice Cream Design is an application that models ice cream in a factory environment, and ice cream at a point of sale (ice cream shop). For ice cream in a factory environment, I've included a method to ```loadTruck```, ```makeIceCream```, and ```calculateRevenue```. While ice cream at a point of sale is given methods to ```makeASale```, ```restock```, and ```placeRestockOrder```. For more information look at the ```factory\IceCream.java``` and ```pointofsale\IceCream.java```.

## RPGInheritance
RPG Inheritance models characters in a video game. Characters all have a parent class ```BaseClass``` and will have seperate properties(& methods if applicable) relative to the character type. In this case, character types include ```Farmer```,```Constable```, and ```Warrior```. Tests are included with this project.

## Customer Composition
Customer Composition is a project that designs a class the repesents a customer. In this class customer includes rirst name, last name, email, phone number, shipping address, billing address, and if this customer is a Rewards Member. Both the shipping address and billing address are objects that will include street 1, street 2, city, state, and zip.
